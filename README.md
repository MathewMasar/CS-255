Portfolio for CS-255 System Analysis and Design


Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
What did you do particularly well?

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?


DriverPass is a driver education company that asked for a single, user friendly website where learners can sign up, study, take practice tests, book physical driving lessons, and receive appointment reminders and receipts alerts. The design focuses on simple booking flows and clear roles (student, instructor, front desk, admin/IT) so each person only sees what they need. The strongest part is the driving lesson sequence- find a time, hold it, confirm it, and get a message. If one area were revised, the class diagram labels would be simplified even further so non technical viewers can scan the few core records like people, lesson times, and confirmations without distraction. 

User needs were translated directly into everyday tasks like schedule or change a lesson, get reminders, study and practice course material, and let staff help when needed. Considering those needs early keeps the system practical, reduces missed appointments, and supports better preparation. For future projects, the approach would stay the same, starting with the people and their goals, map their steps end-to-end, turn those steps into clear screens and checklists, and share quick drafts for feedback. Short trial runs with a few users and simple measures like “how quickly can someone book a lesson” guide small, steady improvements. Dealing with issues singularly like that after deployment helps maintain a usable system.
